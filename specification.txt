Tagging
	The "#" character can be used to tag a task.
	re.findall("(?<!\\\\)#[^ ]+",task)

Special Options (only the first appearances of each option are considered)
	$longterm
		These tasks are do not have specific deadlines and serve as reminders as to what you are working for.
		These goals are listed under a separate category.
	$status=<str> (failed/pending/partial/done, default=pending)
		The current status of the task.
	$required
		This task is not limited to a specific time frame and MUST be completed, thereby activating the "overdue" status.
	$repeat=xxxxxxx (week starts from monday; each x can be 1 or 0)
		Specifies on what days of the week this goal is to be repeated.
		These tasks are listed under a separate category.
		At the first access on each enabled day, a duplicate without this option is added to that day's list.
		The last script access timestamp is recoreded in the data-file for this purpose.
	$comment
		This task is ignored by all actions & interfaces and can only be accessed by directly accessing the text file.
	$date=yyyy-mm-dd (default=today)
		This option is removed from the task list as soon as encountered and the task is shifted to the appropriate date.
		If this option appears along with the $repeat option, it is ignored entirely.
	$deadline=yyyy-mm-dd (default=$date)
		The failure of this task is delayed until this date passes.

Interface
	Command Line
		The default data-file name is "todolist.txt". The data-file must be human readable.
		Options:
			data: name of the file to read data from
		Actions:
			add <task-str>
			list <group> # if group name is omitted, defaults to "today"
			del <group> <id>
			edit <group> <id>
			done <group> <id>
			fail <group> <id>
			part <group> <id>
			backup
			reset
		<group> = date (format: yyyy-mm-dd) / tag (starting with a "#") / "longterm" / "repeated" / "today" / "tomorrow" / "yesterday"
		All actions require confirmation (which is essential wherever <id> is specified, since it may have changed since last script run).

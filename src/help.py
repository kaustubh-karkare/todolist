Operation & TaskGroup Options
	Operations = list | add | done | failed | edit | move | delete
	TaskGroup = Either a specific date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, or
		today | tomorrow | thisweek | yesterday | lastweek | nextweek
		thismonth | lastmonth | nextmonth | forever | periodic
	Note: Weeks are assumed to start from a Monday and end on a Sunday.
\n\
Tags (special and otherwise)
	Basics
		Tasks can include tags, which are basically string without whitespace,
		and prefixed with the hash (#) symbol. While you may create your own
		tags, certain tags have special meanings as explained below.
	Status Tags
		These tags are used to indicate the current status of a task:
		#done | #failed | #impossible (lack of a status tag => #pending)
	Essential Tasks
		Tasks tagged #essential are carried forward from the previous day
		to the current day, if they have not yet been done or failed.
	Tasks with deadlines
		These are similar to #essential tasks, but are not carried forward
		beyond the specified date. To add a deadline to a task, add the tag:
		#deadline=<taskgroup> (requires reference to a specific date)
	Periodic Tasks
		Tasks in the "periodic" taskgroup are automatically added to the group
		corresponding to the current date based on the following special tags:
		#everyday | #weekday | #weekend | #monday | #tuesday | ... | #sunday
	Note: Periodic Tags have a special meaning only if the containing task
		in the special "periodic" group.
\n\
File (data-source)
	The format of file being used as the data-source has kept extremely simple
	so that it can be easily read and manually modified is necessary.
	(1) Lines with no indenting declare a TaskGroup, which must be a specific
		date (format=YYYY-MM-DD) or a special group ("Periodic").
	(2) Once a TaskGroup has been declared, the following lines specify the
		actual task (with tags). A single horizontal tab is used as indentation.
	(3) The last line of the file starts with a hash (#), followed by a space,
		and finally the last script run date (format=YYYY-MM-DD).
	Any deviations from the above specified rules will result in an error.
	Warning: Do not change the last line of the file! Doing so may result in
		unexpected, unwanted & irreversible changes and inconsistencies!
